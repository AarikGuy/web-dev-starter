# Web Dev Starter Code

## Overview

This is a Web Dev Starter kit to help us throughout CS 408. 
It's going to help with any debugging or testing for websites
we'll be developing. This was also a review/warmup of our CS 208
knowledge. 

To run this properly, clone the repository, install Live Preview if you
haven't already. Then click the greetings button to test it's
functionality.
